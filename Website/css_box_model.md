# CSS Box Model

Each element in `HTML` is a rectangular box in CSS.

Each box is consists of four parts:
- [Content Box](content_area.md)
- [Padding Box](padding_area.md)
- [Border Box](border_area.md)
- [Margin Box](margin_area.md)

By default, setting `width` and `height` parameters in CSS will change the size of content box.
This can be changed by setting `box-sizing` to `content-box` or `border-box`.


> Changing size of `border-box` changes the whole area encpusulated by the border of that element. Not just the size
of border.
